# Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

#### Project Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition data to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. The project applies exploratory data analysis, feature preprocessing, and machine learning model evaluation to support data-driven HR decision-making.

#### Dataset Description

The dataset contains employee-related information including:

Demographic attributes

Job-related features

Work experience indicators

Compensation and satisfaction metrics

Target Variable:

Attrition (Yes / No)

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand employee behavior patterns and attrition trends:

Distribution analysis of key features

Attrition comparison across job roles and departments

Correlation analysis to identify influential factors

Visualization of numerical and categorical variables

These insights help uncover drivers of employee turnover.

#### Data Preprocessing

Handled categorical variables using encoding techniques

Applied feature scaling to numerical variables

Selected relevant features for model training

Split data into training and testing sets

#### Machine Learning Models

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict employee attrition:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Model performance was compared using evaluation metrics to identify the most effective approach.

#### Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

The best-performing model was selected based on overall predictive performance.

#### Key Insights

Job role, overtime, and satisfaction levels strongly influence attrition

Certain departments show higher employee turnover

Machine learning models can effectively predict attrition risk

#### Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
